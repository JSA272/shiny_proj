# My Shiny Project
## Child Hunger in the United States


#### Introduction
Hello, users! I've created a very simple Shiny app, because shiny apps are difficult to make. 
Since I'm interested in child poverty in the United States, I wanted to make something revolving around that topic, but with
an element of suprise, to get people thinking.

#### Usage
My app is very easy to use. Simply take a guess how many food-insecure children, defined by the US Department of Agriculture as
children experiencing "limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability
to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways," by entering a number in the text box on the right side of the screen.
Then, click on the "Go" button to make your guess.

#### Output
Once you've clicked the button, the app will reveal the right side of the screen, which will output the correct answer and rate
your guess compared to both the correct answer and a series of guesses made by other users. If I had more time to spend on making
the app, these would have been real guesses stored on the server. However, due to a lack of time, these other guesses have been
simulated using the rnorm() function. 

Enjoy using my app, and good luck to you!
